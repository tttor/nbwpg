This repository contains the research code of our paper
"A nearly Blackwell-optimal policy gradient method"

There are five directories, namely
* `data` contains our raw experimental results in binary files,
* `gym-env` contains a customized gym environment and a small gym utility,
* `main` contains the main research code,
* `plotter` contains the code for plotting, and
* `xprmt` contains bash scripts and configuration files to run experiments.
